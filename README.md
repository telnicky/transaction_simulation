transaction_simulation
======================

Assignment requirements:

For this assignment you are to write a complete application to perform an analysis of inventory for a small wholesale food products company.  Your program will do only the following:

Receive a filename as the only command line parameter.
Read data from the specified text file that describes food items, warehouses, and transactions over a several day period.
Use the transaction information to adjust the inventories for each warehouse.
Print out a report to the console that answers several questions about the data.
Your program should print out only the required report without extra debugging output, prompts, excess whitespace, or other output that would make the output difficult to parse automatically.

You are required to properly use at least two classes to represent data from the file.  (You'll likely use more.)
